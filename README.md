## Bio

Originally from Minsk, Belarus, I graduated from International Sakharov Environmental University and then worked half-time in a [clinical center](https://oncology.by/en/laboratories) studying human immunology. I did my doctorate project in [Henrik Oster](https://www.neurobio.uni-luebeck.de/en/staff/henrik-oster.html)'s group at Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen, and later at the University of Lübeck, focusing on circadian rhythms of adrenal hormones, and contributed to studies of the circadian clock in T cells. I went back to immunology during my postdoctoral research in [Marc Ehlers](https://www.uksh.de/Ernaehrungsmedizin_Luebeck/Wissenschaft/AG+Immunologie+und+Glykoanalytik.html)' group where I studied B cells and mechanisms of antibody glycosylation. Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of [Guru Krishnamoorthy](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/krishnamoorthy) at Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich, studying a role of B cells in multiple sclerosis using animal models of autoimmune central nervous system pathology.
